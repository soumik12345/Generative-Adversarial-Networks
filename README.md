# Generative Adversarial Networks

### 1. [MLP-GAN](./1-MLP-GAN/)
Simple Generative Adversarial Network implemented using Multi Layered Perceptrons and trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can be generated by running the notebooks in the [notebooks](./1-MLP-GAN/notebooks/) folder. To test the pre-trained model run the `test_model.py` script.

### 2. [DCGAN](./2-DCGAN/)
Generative Adversarial Network implemented using Deep Convolutional Networks and trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can be generated by running the notebooks in the [notebooks](./2-DCGAN/notebooks/) folder. To test the pre-trained model run the `test_model.py` script.

### 4. [WGAN](./4-WGAN/)
Generative Adversarial Network implemented using Deep Convolutional Networks and Wassertein's Loss Function trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can be generated by running the notebooks in the [notebooks](./4-WGAN/notebooks/) folder. To test the pre-trained model run the `test_model.py` script.
